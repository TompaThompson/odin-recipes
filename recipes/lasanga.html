      <h1>Lasagne Verdi alla Bolognese</h1>
      <img src="images/lasagne.jpeg" alt="Lasagne Verdi alla Bolognese">
      <p>This is an adaptation of the official lasagne from the Bolognese Chamber
        of Commerce. I've made a couple of changes suggested to me by people from
        the area, such as which meat and wine to use or if there should be milk
        added or not. One thing never in question, though, is the green lasagne
        sheets. These are a must. The ragu is an authentic sauce, simple without
        garlic or herbs and spices. Using fresh pasta keeps you from having to
        pre-boil it.</p>
        <h2>Ingridients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>1 (3 ounce) package pancetta, minced</li>
          <li>½ cup diced carrot</li>
          <li>½ cup diced celery</li>
          <li>½ cup diced yellow onion</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
          <li>7 ounces ground beef</li>
          <li>6 ounces ground pork</li>
          <li>½ cup dry red wine</li>
          <li>1 ½ cups plain tomato sauce</li>
          <li>2 cups vegetable broth, or more as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Saute pancetta in a large stockpot over medium-high heat until fat
            has rendered, 1 to 2 minutes. Add carrot, celery, onion, and oil.
            Cook and stir until vegetables have softened and onion is translucent,
            about 5 minutes. Add beef and pork. Cook, stirring and mashing meat
            into small crumbles, until browned, 5 to 7 minutes more.</li>
          <li>Stir wine into the stockpot and bring to a boil. Add tomato sauce
              and stir; pour in 1 cup broth. Reduce heat to low and partially
              cover the pot to allow steam to escape. Simmer sauce for 1 hour,
              stirring occasionally.</li>
          <li>Pour 1 more cup of broth into the sauce. Continue simmering
                until thick, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Add more broth only if absolutely
                necessary; ragu should drop, not run, off a spoon.</li>
          <li>Start preparing pasta after sauce has been cooking for
                  1 1/2 hours. Bring water and salt to a boil in a small saucepan.
                  Add spinach and cover until it returns to a boil. Stir gently and
                  cook until spinach is heated through. Remove from heat, leave
                  covered, and let cool.</li>
        </ol>
